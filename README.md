# MOTOR_DRIVER

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a DC Motor Driver using an H-Bridge configuration, enabling bidirectional motor control for robotics and automation applications. The circuit uses MOSFETs, BJTs, diodes, resistors, and a SPST switch to drive a DC motor, allowing forward and reverse motion with speed control via PWM.

Features:  
1.Bidirectional control of a DC motor  
2.H-Bridge design for smooth operation  
3.Supports PWM for speed regulation  
4.Low-cost and easy to integrate into robotics and automation systems  

Components:  
1.DC Motor  
2.MOSFETs (IRF540N)  
3.BJTs (BC327, BC548)  
4.Diodes, Resistors, SPST Switch  
5.Breadboard and jumper wires  

Applications:  
1.Robotics  
2.Industrial machinery  
3.Elevators, rolling mills, locomotives, and more
